# Customer Clustering Analysis using K-means

This project analyzes customer data to segment them into meaningful clusters based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values using K-means clustering.

## Whatâ€™s inside?
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- K-means clustering to identify customer segments
- Naming clusters based on behavior (e.g., Pamper cluster, Delight cluster)
- Visualization of clusters with actionable business insights

## How to use
1. Open the Jupyter notebook file `your_notebook.ipynb`.
2. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to see data processing, clustering, and visualization.
3. Replace the input data with your own customer data to apply the clustering.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualization
